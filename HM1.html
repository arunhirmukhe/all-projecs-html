            <p>

                the user sees on the screen or the interface on the screen with which he
                can interact. The front end is very important for the overall look and
                feel of the website. Front-end must be developed by keeping users’
                perspectives in mind so that the design will be user-friendly. The front
                end plays an important role in the success of any website. Hence the
